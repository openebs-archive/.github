## What you will find here...
> [!Important]
This organization contains OLD LEGACY archived repos, projects and files removed from the OpenEBS project. What you'll find here is snapshots of these old artifacts at the time of removal. **These repos are no longer part of the OpenEBS project.** The role of the maintainers is to move repos here, and make sure they continue to be available at the time they were archived. The maintainers of OpenEBS welcome you to continue contributing to repo's by Cloning the repo into another organization. We are not intending to manage contributions, discussions or issues within the OpenEBS-Archive organization. We welcome your feedback and ideas - if you think we can improve how the archiving process works, please open a new issue in [OpenEBS Community](https://github.com/openebs/community/issues/new) and it will be added to the agenda at an upcoming community meeting.
