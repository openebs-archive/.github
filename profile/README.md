## Welcome to the OpenEBS-Archive org
<BR>

### What you will find here...
---
This is the CNCF owned Archive managment org for the OpenEBS project.<BR>

We created this org as a community place where the **OLD LEGACY** archvied project repo's and dependancies will live on seperatly from the parent OpenEBS parent org.
In Jan 2024, we started a major modernization effort (with the CNCF TOC) for the OpenEBS project. During this process we needed to deprecate many old legacy projects
that have lived on too long beyond their orignal planned lifecycle. <BR>

Many of those projects were experiments and needed to be End-Of-Lifed and Archived; but we didn't do a good job of that. <BR>
This causesda messy, confusing user experience for many users of our OpenEBS users. - We needed to fix that. <BR>

This Archive org now holds those artifacts. We have physically moved the OLD LEGACY parts of the parent OpenEBS project here. They are offically DEPRECATED and are
no longer part of OpenEBS.
- ‚òëÔ∏è YES, these archived projects will still work fine
- ‚òëÔ∏è they can still be installed, uninstalled and re-installed
- üí¢ NO they are not supported by the OpenEBS parent team
- ‚òëÔ∏è YES the community is still active and supporting them
- ‚òëÔ∏è YES they can be forked
- üí¢ NO you cannot submit ISSUES and PR's against the code as they're no longer actively being developed by the dev teams

There are some community guidelines associated with the use of this Archvie org...
- It is not guaranteed that all repos and projects will be remain Read/Write
- Some repos will be READ-ONLY (Archived mode) / (this is intentional)
- Eventually all repos will be made READ-ONLY (Archived mode)
- These repos are the **Intellectual Property** of CNCF / Linux Foundation. They are adminstrated by the OpenEBS Maintainers
- Users may request a project to be reinstated / Activated, but this must follow a Governance process (TBD)
- Any reactivated / re-instated repo will not revert back into the OpenEBS parent org.
