## Welcome to the OpenEBS-Archive org
<BR>

### What you will find here...
---
This is the CNCF owned Archive organization for the OpenEBS project.BR>

We created this as a community place where the OLD LEGACY archived repos and dependencies will live on separately from the main parent OpenEBS project. In Jan 2024, we started a major modernization effort for the OpenEBS project (in concert with the CNCF TOC). During this process we needed to deprecate many old legacy projects that had lived long beyond their originally planned lifecycle. <BR>

Many of those projects were experiments and should have been End-Of-Life Archived; but we didn't do a good job of that. This created a messy, confusing user experience for the OpenEBS user community. - We needed to fix that. <BR>

This Archive repository holds those old artifacts. We have physically moved the OLD LEGACY parts of the OpenEBS project here. They are officially DEPRECATED and are no longer part of OpenEBS. <BR>

☑️ YES, these archived projects will still work fine <BR>
☑️ YES they can still be installed, uninstalled and re-installed <BR>
❌ NO they are not supported by the OpenEBS parent project <BR>
☑️ YES the community is still active and supporting them <BR>
☑️ YES they can be forked <BR>
❌ NO you cannot submit ISSUES and PR's against the code. They're not actively being developed by the dev teams <BR>
